## How To Run Project
Once you have downloaded the tarball for the project code, run the following code:
```
tar -xvf sxp170022_p1.tar.gz
make
```

At this time, you should open the following `dc` terminals: `dc02` and `dc22`
- `dc02` will be used to run process P1
- `dc22` will be used to run process P2

__In this order...__
In `dc22`, run `java P2`.
In `dc02`, run `java P1`.

And the project should work!
