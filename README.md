*Disclaimer*: Please do not assume all my code is correct or the most efficient possible. I consider myself to be a wayyy above average coder, but nonethless, I did not score a 100 on every single assignment. Consider using my code is caution and ensure correctness yourself, as I'm not liable for any mistakes you might make, if you consider on using my code (*however, looking in retrospect, I do wish I did upload the feedback I got on each assignment and the grade I got, so rip*).
