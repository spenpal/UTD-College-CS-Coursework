To run this project, make sure you have MongoDB server installed on your system and you have started it up at the default address: `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
- NOTE: There is no code for loading the `ArcadeGames.json` data into the MongoDB database. The `db` and `collection` were created through the `MongoDB VSCode` extension and the data was loaded using the `mongoimport` command.

Then, go into the `src` folder and run `npm install`, followed by `npm run dev`. The project will open up at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
